This repository contains the code and result data for the article 'Designing mobile application messages to impact route choice: a survey and simulation study'.
It consists of two sub-repositories:


| Sub-Repository      | Objective                                                    | Corresponding section in the manuscript | Comments                                                                  |
|---------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| survey-route-choice | Investigate effect of message design on route choice         | II. Survey                              | requires R installed                                                      |
|                     | Compute route choice proportions for the traffic simulation  | III. Traffic assignment model           | requires R installed                                                      |
| crownet             | Investigate effect of message design on congestion situation | IV. Traffic simulation                  | Several requirements (docker, Python, ...)  See README of the repository  |
